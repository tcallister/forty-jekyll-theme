		<p>I spend a lot of time making plots and graphics for talks, and sometimes I'm asked to share these for others to use. This page links to some recent figures, as well as the code used to generate them. Please use in your own talks and presentations! (If you do so, please credit me! You can even star the linked GitHub repos if you wish.)</p>
