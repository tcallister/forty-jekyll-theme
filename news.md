					<h3>"Shouts & Murmurs" shoutout in the New Yorker</h3>
				</header>
				    <p>
                    The most recent New Yorker featured <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/06/10/are-we-doomed-heres-how-to-think-about-it">an article</a> about my collaborator (and current boss!) Daniel Holz and his work thinking about existential risk and humanity's possible imminent doom.
                    In the midst of all of this appeared a quick shoutout to our paper from a few years ago, titled (appropriately for the publication in question): <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ab9743"><em>Shouts and Murmurs: Combining Individual Gravitational-Wave Sources with the Stochastic Background to Measure the History of Binary Black Hole Mergers</em></a>.

					<h3>Featured in Physics Magazine Viewpoint</h3>
				</header>
				    <p>
                    My <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.14.021005">recent paper</a> with Will was featured in Physics Magazine, with a wonderful <a href="https://physics.aps.org/articles/v17/57">"Viewpoint" article</a> written by Maya Fishbach.
                    In her article, Maya pedagogically lays out the methodological differences between traditional parametric vs. "non-parametric" models and describes some highlights from our own work.
                    Thank you, Maya!

					<h3>Non-parametric BBH populations paper in PRX</h3>
				</header>
				    <p>
                    At long last, <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.14.021005">this paper</a> has been published in PRX!
                    Will and I measure the black hole population using an autoregressive process model for the black hole merger rate (this involves doing hierarchical inference with hundreds of thousands of free parameters), checking the robustness of known features and finding fun new ones.
                    This paper was flagged as a "Featured" article.
