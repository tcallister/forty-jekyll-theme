					<h3>Non-parametric BBH populations paper in PRX</h3>

                    At long last, <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.14.021005">this paper</a> has been published in PRX!
                    Will and I measure the black hole population using an autoregressive process model for the black hole merger rate (this involves doing hierarchical inference with hundreds of thousands of free parameters), checking the robustness of known features and finding fun new ones.
                    This paper was flagged as a "Featured" article.
